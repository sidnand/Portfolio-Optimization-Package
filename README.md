# Testing Portfolio Optimization Methods

This is a tool to test the out-of-sample performance using the Sharpe ratio of different portfolio methods against each other. This is based on the paper "Optimal Versus Naive Diversification: How Inefficient is the 1/N Portfolio Strategy?" by Victor DeMiguel, Lorenzo Garlappi and Raman Uppal, and it uses the same models.
